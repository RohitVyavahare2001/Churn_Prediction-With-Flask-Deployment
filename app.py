                    While the complete pipeline code has not yet been fully integrated into the application,
                    we invite you to explore the detailed Jupyter Notebook,
                    which includes the comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), advanced visualizations, and an in-depth evaluation of various models.
                    Among these, the Support Vector Machine (SVM) has been identified as the most effective model for our problem statement.
                    Please refer to the "Final.ipynb" file, which is included in the shared zip folder, for a thorough review of the code, model training, and performance metrics across different machine learning models. 
                    We are excited about the progress weâ€™ve made and look forward to sharing the complete implementation with you soon"""
