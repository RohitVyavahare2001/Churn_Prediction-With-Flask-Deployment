# Prediction Result Application

This project is a **web-based prediction result application** that displays user predictions and additional information in a clean, user-friendly format. The application also provides a mechanism to explore detailed machine learning models and pipeline analysis through an embedded **Jupyter Notebook**.

## Features

- Display prediction results with user-specific details such as:
  - Gender, Age, Tenure, Monthly Charges, and Total Charges.
  - Service Usage Metrics and Payment Method.
  - The final prediction outcome.
- Integrated **SweetAlert2** pop-up for important user messages.
- A link to detailed **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** and model evaluation through a downloadable `final.ipynb` notebook.
- Clean, responsive UI design with modern styling.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, SweetAlert2
- **Backend**: Flask (Python)
- **Machine Learning Models**: Support Vector Machines (SVM) and other algorithms (explored in the notebook)
- **Tools and Libraries**: 
  - Jupyter Notebook for EDA and model training.
  - Flask for routing and serving static files.
